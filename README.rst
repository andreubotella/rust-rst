Designed around the `Docutils Document Tree`_ and the `reStructuredText specification`_, this is supposed to become a library able to convert reStructuredText and Docutils XML to both each other and HTML5.

This project is dual-licensed under Apache 2.0 and MIT.

.. _reStructuredText specification: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html

.. note::
   If you are looking for the requirements tracking tool rst (Requirements, Specifications and Tests), have a look at the rst_app package instead.
